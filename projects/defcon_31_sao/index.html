  <div class="post">
    <p>Over the course of my career I have been to a number of conferences, as an attendee, a vendor, and a speaker. I love conferences. In recent years though, my job hasn&rsquo;t encouraged participating, so I found myself curating conferences I would want to go to for personal reasons rather than professional ones. The Hackaday Supercon, Crowdsupply Teardown, and Defcon, always make the list. There are &ldquo;grown up&rdquo; conferences for makers. Unlike Maker Faires, which are more and more geared towards kids and education, Those conferences are meant for adult enthusiasts (kids are welcome anyways but they&rsquo;re not the focus), and are meant for enthusiasts and engineers to get together and showcase, share and have fun with tech.</p>
<p>Defcon introduced electronic badges many years ago, and from there spawned a &ldquo;movement&rdquo;, #badgelife, that many conferences have embraced. Now most of these conferences sport electronic badges, and there are many &ldquo;unofficial&rdquo; badges built by villages, local defcon chapters, enthusiasts, etc. These badges blend art, technology and often hacking. Some have become collectibles.</p>
<p>Those badges have extension ports, that allow smaller circuits to be plugged into them. These smaller circuits are jokingly referred to as &ldquo;Shitty Add-Ons&rdquo; or SAOs, and they are cheaper and easier to make, and represent an entrypoint into #badgelife for people who would like to participate. I always wanted to make one.</p>
<p>Lo and behold, Defcon 31 badge was announced: and it wasn&rsquo;t an electronic badge. A work of art none-the-less, but not a blinky one. For my first SAO, I wouldn&rsquo;t rely on the SAO standard then, and would make a self contained blinky thing that would fit in the &ldquo;port&rdquo; left open for creativity. Details <a href="https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2031/DEF%20CON%2031%20badge/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Having made a last minute decision to attend Defcon this year (due to a broken wrist) I had 2 weeks to build something.</p>
<p>It would have to fit into the badge &ldquo;chamber&rdquo; so I decided to make it 3 parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A PCB whose only goal would be to light up 1 LED</li>
<li>A &ldquo;shard&rdquo; that would be a 3d printed flat part that would fit solidly into the chamber and would be used to &ldquo;hold&rdquo; the PCB in place</li>
<li>A 3D printed accessory mounted on the LED bulb itself</li>
</ul>
<p>I set a goal for myself to produce 30 units and give them to people who were being nice or showing cool things at Defcon 31. (Spoiler alert: I ran out by the end of day 2). Here&rsquo;s the result:</p>
<p><img src="/projects/defcon_31_sao_imgs/sao_lit.jpeg" alt="SAO with the LED shining through" title="SAO with the LED shining through">
<img src="/projects/defcon_31_sao_imgs/sao_glow.jpeg" alt="SAO glowing with the LED turned off" title="SAO glowing with the LED turned off"></p>
<p>With only 14 days to the conference, I had to make 30 units in 1 go.</p>
<h1 id="the-pcb">The PCB</h1>
<p>The fastest PCB fab I knew how to use is Oshpark&rsquo;s in fast turnaround mode, which takes about 5 business days. That would eat into half the alloted time already, and I had one chance at getting it right. Having designed very few, uber simple PCBs in the past, i knew I had to keep it extremely simple as I couldn&rsquo;t afford to make multiple prototypes. I also had to use parts already on my shelves to avoid delivery times. I figured I wouldn&rsquo;t have time for an MCU based thing, so I went for the simplest design I could do with parts I already had:</p>
<ul>
<li>CR2012 batteries (and battery holders)</li>
<li>Micro-switches</li>
<li>Color-changing LEDs that don&rsquo;t require current-limiting resistors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the design files: <a href="https://github.com/pierreca/defcon31_sao">3D models and KiCad project on Github</a></p>
<p>Unfortunately Fedex did not do me a solid and even though I had paid for overnight shipping, I had ignored the fact that this was a business service that doesn&rsquo;t deliver on the weekend. So my one assembly weekend was spent experimenting with the 3D design of the shard and accessory, and I would have to solder all 3 PCBs in the 2 days before my flight out.</p>
<h1 id="the-shard">The shard</h1>
<p>The shard design itself was meant to be a simple flat part that would fit into the chamber and hold the PCB: another redditor had already made 3d models that I could start from and posted them on thingiverse: <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6060558">https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6060558</a></p>
<p>Using Kicad 3d visualization feature, I was able to export a 3D model of the PCB.</p>
<p>I then imported both the shard design and the PCB STL files into Shapr3D and went through 3 iterations to find a proper mounting mechanism. I wanted to avoid fasteners, so it would have to be friction-fit.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first design was kindof stupid: for the sake of leaving the PCB exposed, i had to make smaller brackets, and a weirdly shaped cutout for the micro-switch and battery:</li>
<li>The second design was much better: PCB can fit squarely in the back, only the LED gets exposed in the front, but it wasn&rsquo;t placed correctly in the chamber (too high)</li>
<li>The third design did the trick: the shard provided a nice even surface with only an LED poking out. the PCB was easy to insert from the back. I had arranged reliefs to make manipulating the switch and changing the battery simpler.</li>
</ul>

<p>As seen from the back, with the PCB inserted:</p>

<h1 id="the-accessory">The accessory</h1>
<p>I initially had the idea of printing multiple accessories and letting recipients of the SAO choose their preferred one, but I was also struggling with the choice of material. Transparent filament isn&rsquo;t really transparent (not glass-like anyways) and doesn&rsquo;t look nice lit from behind. Glow in the dark filament had a nice diffusion factor to it and had the benefit of still shining a bit even if the LED was off. Out of the 2 I picked, one of them was a nightmare to print with, consistently clogging the nozzle. So I ended up with [Glow in the dark PETG from Sainsmart](TODO Link). By the time i was done experimenting with filaments, I had only one design: a tiny &ldquo;Defcon Jack&rdquo; that i had lifted from the defcon logo and rendered in 3D in Shapr3D. I figured it would do the trick and that I didn&rsquo;t need to find other accessories.</p>
<p><img src="/projects/defcon_31_sao_imgs/shard_front.jpeg" alt="Shard with the defcon jack accessory" title="Shard with the defcon jack accessory"></p>
<h1 id="test-fit">Test fit</h1>
<p>In order to make sure the design worked, I printed 2 version of the &ldquo;chamber&rdquo;:</p>
<ul>
<li>The STL File directly from the Defcon media server</li>
<li>Another version that was split in 2 parts by another redditor</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/projects/defcon_31_sao_imgs/chamber_1.jpeg" alt="3D Printed chambers for the test fit" title="3D Printed chambers for the test fit">
<img src="/projects/defcon_31_sao_imgs/chamber_2.jpeg" alt="3D Printed chambers for the test fit" title="3D Printed chambers for the test fit"></p>
<p>If the SAO fit both versions, I was decently sure I had done what I could</p>
<h1 id="packaging">Packaging</h1>
<p>As the deadline approached I realize fishing 3 different parts to be assembled from a loose bag would be a poor experience, so I decided to package each SAO individually. In doing this I was reminded that packaging will be the first impression, and I decided to improve the value of the package a bit: on top of the SAO, I would add a UV lamp (to prime the &ldquo;glow-in-the-dark&rdquo; accessory), a spare battery, and for a lucky few, a second accessory from the limited quantity of glow-in-the-dark PLA prints that didn&rsquo;t fail.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the result:</p>
<p><img src="/projects/defcon_31_sao_imgs/packaged.jpeg" alt="Package" title="Package">
<img src="/projects/defcon_31_sao_imgs/package_content.jpeg" alt="Content of the package" title="Content of the package"></p>
<p>I decided to not include any reference to social media (I don&rsquo;t actively maintain any social media account) or myself (in case people hated it or it caught fire etc). Turns out it didn&rsquo;t catch fire, people loved it, and I wasted an opportunity to stay in touch with the fine folks I met. Lesson learned. I will sign my work in the future.</p>
