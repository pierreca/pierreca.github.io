      <description>Flying around Maui, Molokai and Lanai If like me you would like to fly yourself around Maui, I highly recommend Maui Aviators at Kahului. The following is pretty much my recollection of the flight I did with them that includes a checkout and a slightly customized version of their Circle Maui County flight with instruction tidbits I got from the CFI I flew with, Steve Ludlow.
Mandatory boring disclaimer: There is obviously a lot more to flying the Hawaiian islands than what is described below - this isn&amp;rsquo;t supposed to be instruction, official source of information such as charts and chart supplements, or a substitute for good ADM or risk management.</description>

      <description>Tips for taking pictures from airplanes and helicopters Wear dark clothes: bright/light-colored clothes will create reflections on the windows Consider using a polarizing filter to get rid of glare (but know how to use it - and understand the consequences of it too&amp;hellip;) Go manual or go home: autofocus will be tripped by reflections and the speed at which things are moving Bracketing is of no use if you&amp;rsquo;re taking pictures of what is outside the airplane: you&amp;rsquo;re moving too fast Bracketing is great if you&amp;rsquo;re taking pictures inside the plane and still want to see what&amp;rsquo;s outside the window Bring limited gear: changing lenses and fiddling with equipment in a small cockpit is difficult Try to plan the flight and what you want to take pictures off (ask the pilot for the flight route!</description>
